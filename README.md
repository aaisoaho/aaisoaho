# Hi! 👋

MSc. majored in Computer Science.

I wrote my master's thesis on the subject of Software Developers' Playfulness, motivation and work atmosphere. The thesis can be found at [JYX](https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/80955) and it is only available in Finnish. 

## Other git profiles

[My GitLab Account](https://gitlab.jyu.fi/aakaneis) is used on some projects I did while studying at JYU. 

## Portfolio

[My Confluence wiki pages](https://wiki.jyu.fi/display/pelihaaste/Isoaho+Aaron) contains some game jam -style of game designs and prototypes I did for the Game Development Challenge -course. The said page contains 4 game designs and book keeping of the hours spent on them. 

First game was a rhythm game about perfectionism. The design limitation was to only use a single button to control the character. The finished game design document can be found [here](https://wiki.jyu.fi/display/pelihaaste/Pelisuunnitelma+1.0).

Second game jam product was an AR toy mimicking a "hologram" table you usually see in science fiction. The source code was lost at a malfunction, but the toy design document can be found [here](https://wiki.jyu.fi/display/pelihaaste/Sci-Fi-Sci-Kit+suunnitelma+0.1).

Third game jam product was an educational game trying to teach Finite Automata Graphs with a tabletop style of game. The game design document can be found [here](https://wiki.jyu.fi/display/pelihaaste/Near+Automata+-+Pelisuunnitelma+0.1).

I worked on an [educational game project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cundkYVs_Q) with a real life customer. My roles on the said project:
Programming and audio design - and the roles include tasks such as: audio design, composing, audio engineering and game design. The link to the game itself and the source code can be accessed by contacting me. 

On DevOps course I was a part of a group assigned to create an interactive beemap web app. To gain access to the source code of the said project, contact me.

You can find some small game projects I've done also from the repository [Game Technology](https://github.com/aaisoaho/TIES476). These projects were done as a part of Game Technology course for the University of Jyväskylä.
