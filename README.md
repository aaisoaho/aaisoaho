# Hi! üëã

I'm currently a MSc. Student at the university of Jyv√§skyl√§. 

I wrote my master's thesis on the subject of Software Developers' Playfulness, motivation and work atmosphere. The thesis can be found at [JYX](https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/80955) and it is only available in Finnish. 

## Other git profiles

[My GitLab Account](https://gitlab.jyu.fi/aakaneis) is used on some projects I do while studying at JYU. 

## Portfolio

[My Confluence wiki pages](https://wiki.jyu.fi/display/pelihaaste/Isoaho+Aaron) contains some game jam -style of game designs and prototypes I did for the Game Development Challenge -course. The said page contains 4 game designs and book keeping of the hours spent on them. 

I worked on an [educational game project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cundkYVs_Q) with a real life customer. My roles on the said project:
Programming and audio design - and the roles include tasks such as: audio design, composing, audio engineering and game design. The link to the game itself and the source code can be accessed by contacting me. 

On DevOps course I was a part of a group assigned to create an interactive beemap web app. To gain access to the source code of the said project, contact me.

You can find some small game projects I've done also from the repository [Game Technology](https://github.com/aaisoaho/TIES476). These projects were done as a part of Game Technology course for the University of Jyv√§skyl√§.
