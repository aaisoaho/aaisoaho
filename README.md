# Me right now

I'm currently a MSc. Student at the university of Jyv√§skyl√§. 
Course topics I've finished recently includes:

- Music and sounds in games
- Semantic web and linked data
- DevSecOps

Right now I'm studying such topics as:

- Creative writing
- Game project (educational game project about social media and its risks) 
- Game technology

## What do I want

I've envisioned myself to be a quite an allrounder designer. I see myself to be an empty canvas with a potential to become either a software designer or a game designer. For me, the game designer would be a dream come true. 
How I would approach the said dreamjob is first to land a job as a junior game developer and from there working and learning to become what I want. 

However, I would not be sad if I were to become a software developer or a software designer - it would be quite the opposite. I would love 
the development and the design of the software just the same. I think I could use my creativity and problem solving skills also on the software side.

# Other profiles

[My GitLab Account](https://gitlab.jyu.fi/aakaneis) is used on some projects I do while studying at JYU
Most notable projects include the game project we do. My role on the said project is formally Audio Designer and Programmer, 
but the tasks in practice includes audio designing, composing, audio engineering, game design and developing.

# Fun facts

As a teenager, I spent years on making games with Game Maker (first on Game Maker 6.1 and then moving on to Game Maker Studio). It was my hobby and
I did quite a lot of game development, pixel graphics and game design. It was the hobby that brought me to my studies.
I won my study rights for the BSc. And MSc. of Computer Science thanks to this hobby. 

I love cooking - like a lot. It is the way I relax and divert my attention from computers. I've spent quite a lot of time honing my pizza making skills and I do make 
a tasty brown sauce.
